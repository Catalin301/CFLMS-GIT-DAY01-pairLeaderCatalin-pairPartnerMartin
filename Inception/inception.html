	<h1>Inception - The movie</h1>
	<h3><i>A movie you must watch</i></h3>

	<p><b>Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film[4][5] written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced the film with his wife, Emma Thomas. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious.[6] The ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.</b></p>

	<p><sub>After the 2002 completion of Insomnia, Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page treatment for a horror film envisioning "dream stealers," based on lucid dreaming.[7] Deciding he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and complexity, Nolan retired the project and instead worked on 2005's Batman Begins, 2006's The Prestige, and The Dark Knight in 2008.[8] The treatment was revised over 6 months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009.[9] Inception was filmed in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22.[10] Its official budget was US$160 million, split between Warner Bros and Legendary.[11] Nolan's reputation and success with The Dark Knight helped secure the film's US$100 million in advertising expenditure.</sub></p><br>
